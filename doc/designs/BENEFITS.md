# Benefits of Power-Capped LLM Inference Service using Kubernetes

## Motivation

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and enabled powerful applications like
question answering, text generation, and sentiment analysis. However, serving LLMs at scale presents significant
challenges in terms of computational resources and power consumption. Data centers hosting LLM inference services often
face power constraints, limiting the number of servers that can be deployed and the overall throughput of the system.

The motivation behind the power-capped LLM inference service using Kubernetes is to address these challenges by
providing a scalable and power-efficient solution for serving LLMs. By leveraging Kubernetes and a custom power capping
operator, this project aims to optimize power utilization, improve throughput, and reduce the carbon footprint of LLM
inference services.
